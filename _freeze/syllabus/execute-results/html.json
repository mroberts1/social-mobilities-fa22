It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated  **practices** of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of **social media theory**. But what does it mean to **theorize** social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?\n\nTo theorize something involves a number of processes:\n\n- first, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?\n- how are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?\n- what is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?\n- how are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?\n\nThese processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question.\n\nEach week of the course focuses on some of the key dimensions of social media communication:\n\n- the role of **language** in social media and its transformation;  \n- the **aesthetic** dimension of social media communication and the centrality of the **image** as a unit of exchange on social media platforms;  \n- the dimension of **sharing** that is arguably the central practice of social media;\n- the **affective** or emotionally-expresssive dimension of social media, i.e. their role in articulating and sharing **structures of feeling**;  \n- critiques of the **surveillance capitalism** of commercial SM platforms and debates about their practices as a form of **techno-feudalism**;    \n- the notion of social media as a complex **ecosystem** of interdependent practices, as well as proposals for addressing toxic elements within this ecosystem.\n\n***\n\n## OBJECTIVES  \nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\n- analyze technologies past, present, and imagined\n- describe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies\n- explain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics\n- discuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student\n- play a productive role in and even facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology.  \n- through the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.  \n\n***  \n\n## SOURCES: PRINT/WEB  \n\n**Required**  \nThese texts have been ordered by the University bookstore.\n\n- Nicholas A.

This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.\n\n***\n\n## MANDATORY REPORTER\nFitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit [http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix](http://fitchburgstate.edu/titleix) to access information about university support and resources.\n\n***\n\n## HEALTH\n[Health Services](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitchburgstate.edu%2Foffices-services-directory%2Fhealth-services%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEw5V0i0hL5DVO5b43gejNNaAt4ig)\n\nHours: Monday-Friday 8:30AM-5PM\nLocation: Ground Level of Russell Towers (across from the entrance of Holmes Dining Hall) Phone: (978) 665-3643/3894\n\n[Counseling Services](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitchburgstate.edu%2Foffices-services-directory%2Fcounseling-services%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEYiS4EmSvWerpp2bKr5lTpouPuqQ)\n\nThe Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room 317.\n\n[Fitchburg Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitchburgstate.edu%2Foffices-services-directory%2Ffitchburg-anti-violence-education%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFi5qy-wunMxX-hoWbA9YwT8aa4Ig)\n\nFAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA Domestic Violence Services, Pathways for Change) to meet our training needs and to link survivors with community based resources. This site also features [resources](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitchburgstate.edu%2Foffices-services-directory%2Ffitchburg-anti-violence-education%2Ffitchburg-anti-violence-education-resources%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF9KZ2O1AvPMLJTHdNg1DfmYYtgog) for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.\n\n_Community Food Pantry_\nFood insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food, basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.\n\nThe university continues to partner with Our Father's House to support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each “household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a valid FSU ID.\n\n***\n\n## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY\nThe University “Academic Integrity” policy can be found online at [http:// www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conductmediation-education/academic-integrity/.](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/office-of-student-conduct-mediation-education/academic-integrity/) Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.\n\nPlagiarism includes, but is not limited to:\n-   Using papers or work from another class.\n-   Using another student's paper or work from any class.\n-   Copying work or a paper from the Internet.\n-   The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.\n    \n_If you're not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I'm a strong supporter of_ _[Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use) doctrine. Just attribute what you use--and, again, ASK if there's any doubt._\n\n***\n\n## AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)\nIf you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as possible.\n\n***\n\n## TECHNOLOGY\nAt some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:\n\n-   Plan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.\n    \n-   Save work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.\n    \n-   Make regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.\n    \n-   Save drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.\n    \n-   Practice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.\n    \n  ***\n\n## GRADING POLICY\nGrading for the course will follow the FSU grading policy below:\n\n4.0: 95-100  \n3.7: 92-94  \n3.5: 89-91  \n3.3: 86-88  \n3.0: 83-85  \n2.7: 80-82  \n2.5: 77-79  \n2.3: 74-76  \n2.0: 71-73  \n0.0: < 70  \n\n***\n\n## ACADEMIC RESOURCES\n\n[Writing Center](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/tutor-center/writing-help/)\n\n[Academic Policies](http://catalog.fitchburgstate.edu/content.php?catoid=13&navoid=851)\n\n[Disability Services](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/disability-services/)\n\n[Fitchburg State Alert system for emergencies, snow closures/delays, and faculty absences](https://www.getrave.com/login/fitchburgstate/)\n\n[University Career Services](http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/offices-services-directory/career-counseling-and-advising/careerservices/)\n\n***\n\n\n",
