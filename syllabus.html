<h1>COMM 7018: SOCIAL MEDIA THEORY</h1>
<p>Fitchburg State University<br>
Communications Media Department<br>
MS in Applied Communication: Social Media Concentration</p>
<p>Schedule: Monday 16 May – Monday 4 July 2022<br>

<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The term <strong>social media</strong> is popularly understood as referring to corporate-owned, advertising-funded communication <strong>platforms</strong> based on <strong>user-generated content</strong>: YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord, TikTok. It can also be defined more broadly, however, as a set of networked, technologically-mediated <strong>practices</strong> of communication, structured by economic and political forces that both inflect and are inflected by social and cultural identities. These platforms, the social practices that they enable, and the relationship between the two are the objects of <strong>social media theory</strong>. But what does it mean to <strong>theorize</strong> social media? Why do we need social media theory at all?</p>
<p>To theorize something involves a number of processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, how do we define the phenomenon or object of study itself? How does it differ from previous or other related phenomena?</li>
<li>how are we to account for it? Why did it happen/is it happening now rather than at some other time? What are its conditions of possibility?</li>
<li>what is its relation to larger areas of society? What are its implications for those areas?</li>
<li>how are we to evaluate it, in terms of its implications (political, economic, social, ethical, legal, environmental, aesthetic)? What are its possibilities and limits, its progressive and oppressive aspects? How can we change it for the better?</li>
</ul>
<p>These processes involve developing analytical frameworks or models comprising concepts that are useful for identifying and analyzing key aspects of and issues raised by the phenomenon/object in question. These frameworks and concepts typically draw from existing ones in different fields of study, but often involve the proposal of new frameworks and concepts specific to the field in question.</p>
<p>Each week of the course focuses on some of the key dimensions of social media communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>the role of <strong>language</strong> in social media and its transformation;<br>
</li>
<li>the <strong>aesthetic</strong> dimension of social media communication and the centrality of the <strong>image</strong> as a unit of exchange on social media platforms;<br>
</li>
<li>the dimension of <strong>sharing</strong> that is arguably the central practice of social media;</li>
<li>the <strong>affective</strong> or emotionally-expresssive dimension of social media, i.e.&nbsp;their role in articulating and sharing <strong>structures of feeling</strong>;<br>
</li>
<li>critiques of the <strong>surveillance capitalism</strong> of commercial SM platforms and debates about their practices as a form of <strong>techno-feudalism</strong>;<br>
</li>
<li>the notion of social media as a complex <strong>ecosystem</strong> of interdependent practices, as well as proposals for addressing toxic elements within this ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyze technologies past, present, and imagined</li>
<li>describe the ways in which technologies shape our world the ways in which we shape those technologies</li>
<li>explain how social media is a result of the intersection between technologies and existing human communication dynamics</li>
<li>discuss how theory of technology and social media can improve the vocational outlook of a student</li>
<li>play a productive role in and even facilitate conversations that tease out the relationships between values and technology.<br>
</li>
<li>through the skills you will refine in writing your research papers, clearly explain how a specific technology shapes the social world that we live in.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="late-policy">LATE POLICY</h2>
<p>Assignments that are late will lose 1/2 of a grade per day, beginning at the end of class and including weekends and holidays. This means that a paper, which would have received an A if it was on time, will receive a B+ the next day, B- for two days late, and so on. Time management, preparation for our meetings, and timely submission of your work comprise a significant dimension of your professionalism. As such, your work must be completed by the beginning of class on the day it is due. If you have a serious problem that makes punctual submission impossible, you must discuss this matter with me before the due date so that we can make alternative arrangements. Because you are given plenty of time to complete your work, and major due dates are given to you well in advance, last minute problems should not preclude handing in assignments on time.</p>

Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<p>Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: - Using papers or work from another class. - Using another student’s paper or work from any class. - Copying work or a paper from the Internet. - The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.</p>
<p><em>If you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a strong supporter of</em> <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use">Fair Use</a> doctrine. Just attribute what you use–and, again, ASK if there’s any doubt.</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technology">TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>At some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file; the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can protect yourself by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.</p></li>
<li><p>Save work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I auto save every 2 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Make regular backups of files in a different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Save drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use software to control viruses and malware.</p></li>
</ul>
