<h3 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>This seminar is an exploration of what it means to live with
personal, portable, and handheld media technologies. We will study these
technologies across time and space by situating them within their
historical contexts and by studying their use in various settings. We’ll
also employ a variety of theoretical frameworks and interdisciplinary
approaches. Simultaneously, we will attempt to analyze and theorize our
own handheld media experiences through and against the course
readings.</p>

<p><strong>Platforms</strong><br />
We’ll be using Blackboard for submitting assignments ONLY. For
discussion, we will be using Discord.</p>
<p>On Discord, if you don’t already have an account, please set one up
using your Fitchburg State University email address as ID.</p>
<p>If you already have a Discord account there will be problems setting
up an account for the course because each account has to be tied to a
different phone number, so you will not be able to use your regular
phone number for verification. For this reason, you may use your
existing account, but if you use a pseudonym please let me know what
this is so I know who you are!</p>
<p>Please be sure to check in to the site at least once daily M-F to
check the Announcements page and the Discussion forum for the week.</p>
<p><strong>Sources</strong><br />
For reading, we will use ebooks, PDFs, and audiobooks.</p>
<p>PDF documents and the syllabus will be available for download in the

<p>Fitchburg State University is committed to providing a safe learning
environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination
and harassment. Please be aware all FSU faculty members are “mandatory
reporters,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving
sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence,
or stalking, I am legally required to share that information with the
Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has been impacted by
sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or
stalking, FSU has staff members trained to support you. If you or
someone you know has been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault,
dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please visit <a

<p>The Counseling Services Office offers a range of services including
individual, couples and group counseling, crisis intervention,
psychoeducational programming, outreach ALTERNATIVE ECOSYSTEMSs, and
community referrals. Counseling services are confidential and are
offered at no charge to all enrolled students. Staff at Counseling
Services are also available for consultation to faculty, staff and
students. Counseling Services is located in the Hammond, 3rd Floor, Room

Anti-Violence Education (FAVE)</strong></a></p>
<p>FAVE collaborates with a number of community partners (e.g., YWCA

for help or information about dating violence, domestic violence, sexual
assault and stalking. If you or someone you know is in an abusive
relationship or has been a victim of sexual assault, there are many
places to go for help. Many can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, 365 days a year. On campus, free and confidential support is
provided at both Counseling Services and Health Services.</p>
<p><strong>Community Food Pantry</strong><br />
Food insecurity is a growing issue and it certainly can affect student
learning. The ability to have access to nutritious food is incredibly
vital. The Falcon Bazaar, located in Hammond G 15, is stocked with food,
basic necessities, and can provide meal swipes to support all Fitchburg
State students experiencing food insecurity for a day or a semester.</p>
<p>The university continues to partner with Our Father’s House to
support student needs and access to food and services. All Fitchburg
State University students are welcome at the Our Father’s House
Community Food Pantry. This Pantry is located at the Faith Christian
Church at 40 Boutelle St., Fitchburg, MA and is open from 5-7pm. Each
“household” may shop for nutritious food once per month by presenting a
valid FSU ID.</p>

Students are expected to do their own work. Plagiarism and cheating are
inexcusable. Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will automatically
result in a zero on the assignment and may be reported the Office of
Student and Academic Life at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<p>Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using papers or work from another class.</li>
<li>Using another student’s paper or work from any class.</li>
<li>Copying work or a paper from the Internet.</li>
<li>The egregious lack of citing sources or documenting research.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you’re not clear on what is or is not plagiarism, ASK. The
BEST case scenario if caught is a zero on that assignment, and ignorance
of what does or does not count is not an excuse. That being said, I’m a

ACT (ADA)</h3>
<p>If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a
disability, if you have emergency medical information to share with the
instructor, or if you need special arrangements in case the building
must be evacuated, please inform the faculty member as soon as
possible.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="incomplete-and-late-assignments">INCOMPLETE AND LATE
ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
<p>If you are not able to complete your work, please make every effort
to contact your instructor <strong>before the due date</strong>. I am
willing to make accommodations where necessary, but will assign a 0 if
work is not submitted and we do not make other arrangements.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="technology-excuse-statement">TECHNOLOGY EXCUSE STATEMENT</h3>
<p>At some point during the semester you will likely have a problem with
technology. Your laptop will crash; your iPad battery will die; a
recording you make will disappear; you will accidentally delete a file;
the wireless will go down at a crucial time. These, however, are
inevitabilities of life, not emergences. Technology problems are not
excuses for unfinished or late work. Bad things may happen, but you can
protect yourself by doing the following:</p>
<p>- Plan ahead: A deadline is the last minute to turn in material. You
can start—and finish—early, particularly if challenging resources are
required, or you know it will be time consuming to finish this project.
- Save work early and often: Think how much work you do in 10 minutes. I
auto save every 2 minutes. - Make regular backups of files in a
different location: Between Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, you
have ample places to store and backup your materials. Use them. - Save
drafts: When editing, set aside the original and work with a copy.
- Practice safe computing: On your personal devices, install and use
software to control viruses and malware.</p>
